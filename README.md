Title: Update index.ts

1. **Addition of Functions**: Two functions, `addNumbers` and `divNumbers`, have been added to the file. Both functions are designed to take two numbers as arguments.
   - `addNumbers`: Returns the sum of the two arguments.
   - `divNumbers`: Returns the result of dividing the first argument by the second, handling division by zero by returning `null`.

2. **Console Output**: Two console.log statements have been added to test the newly added functions.
   - The first log statement tests `addNumbers(5, 3)` and is expected to output `8`.
   - The second log statement tests `divNumbers(4, 0)` and will now handle division by zero by outputting `null`.
